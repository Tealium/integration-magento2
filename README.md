# tealium_magento2
Magento 2.X extension to deploy Tealium code.

## Introduction
Tealium's official integration for TiQ on the Magento 2 framework. In its current state it is an implementation of some minimal boiler plate code for implementing and extending universal data objects (UDOs) for various page types. It relies heavily on Magento's prescribed dependency injection system and layout systems. Included is a simple script that will scaffold out boiler plate code when creating a new UDO. It allows you to specify any UDOs that it may extend, and which pages of the site the new UDO should appear on. When finished, you're left with a scaffolded template that just needs to be filled in with any data specific logic for your particular use case.

You can get started understanding the UDO and concepts of a data layer at [https://community.tealiumiq.com/t5/Getting-Started/Getting-Started-with-The-Data-Layer/ta-p/9503](https://community.tealiumiq.com/t5/Getting-Started/Getting-Started-with-The-Data-Layer/ta-p/9503).

Documentation on Magento can be found at [http://devdocs.magento.com/](http://devdocs.magento.com/).

## Requirements
You will need the following items:
- An active Tealium IQ Account
- Your Tealium Account Id (it will likely be your company name)

    - prod
